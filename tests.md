The initial static charge buildup typically occurs through processes like friction or separation of materials. When two materials come into contact and then are separated, electrons can be transferred from one material to another, leading to an imbalance of charges. This initial charging process allows for the buildup of static electricity. Once charged, if the materials are insulators or if the surrounding environment limits the flow of electrons, the charge can persist until discharge conditions are met, like coming into contact with a conductive material or a change in environmental conditions.

Static electricity can cause objects to stick together due to the attraction of opposite charges. When an object gains an excess of electrons (becomes negatively charged) or loses electrons (becomes positively charged), it can attract neutral objects nearby. This attraction can create a temporary bond, making things seem to "stick" together.

Cool. So if I understand you correctly, input could be numbers, feed into an encoder that represents the input in a mathematical space (what would a standard name be for it?) And the encoder produces inupt embeddings which are number representation of positions in the space, then the output list of numbers are feed into the core network, which modifies those position values through each layers until the last which feed it's embeddings which we call last latent space, into the decoder, which then decodes these values back to understandable values?
